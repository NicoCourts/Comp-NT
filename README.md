# Playing Around with Computational Number Theory
My interests lie somewhere at the intersection of math and computer science, so in the process of writing out [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) solutions<sup>\*</sup> and decided to also try to code up some methods of (integer) factorization as well as elliptic curves.

At the moment my goal is to code up something akin to [Leenstra elliptic curve factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenstra_elliptic-curve_factorization) but my interests may stray.

<sub><sup>\*</sup> I completed more of the PE problems several years ago but wanted to take some time and really nail the solutions to them again to shore up my fundamentals.</sub>
