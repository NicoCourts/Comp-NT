# Playing Around with Computational Number Theory
My interests lie somewhere at the intersection of math and computer science, so in the process of writing out [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) solutions<sup>1</sup> and decided to also try to code up some methods of (integer) factorization as well as elliptic curves.

At the moment my goal is to code up something akin to [Leenstra elliptic curve factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenstra_elliptic-curve_factorization) but my interests may stray.

<sub>[1] Note: At one point I had planned on carefully writing up solutions to every problem to PE, but in the end I realized that many of the earlier problems had very unsatisfying solutions (e.g. just brute force it for every prime under 1000000). I was also told that I shouldn't really post solutions publicly so that's a thing. So for now you can just check out my little PE badge or go look me up:
